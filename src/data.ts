At that time, there was an environmental problem in my country that made many people angry and they created a petition on Change dot org and shared it on Facebook. I am very interested in the idea of this website, it is really helpful and it has a strong life impact. I wonder why there is not such a website in my country? I think every country should have such a website and the world should have more than one in the community. So I decided to quit my part-time job and start developing a platform for social movements.",
